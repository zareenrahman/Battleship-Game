Battleship, also known as Battleships or Sea Battle, is a strategy-based guessing game designed for two players. The game unfolds on ruled grids, either on paper or a board, where each player's fleet of warships is strategically positioned. The locations of these fleets are concealed from the opposing player, adding an element of surprise and strategy to the gameplay.
